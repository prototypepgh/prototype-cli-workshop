# Welcome to the Prototype PGH Introduction to the Command Line Workshop

## Before the workshop

Please [get an account on PythonAnywhere](https://github.com/prototypepgh/prototype-cli-workshop/blob/master/get_account.md). It's free. It takes a few minutes and would be good to do ahead of time.

## During the workshop

The slides are available [here](http://bit.ly/cli-prototype-slides), and you can follow along with the commands from the slides and their output [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prototypepgh/prototype-cli-workshop/master/command_line_basics.txt). 

We welcome you to work through any of the exercises that seem interesting to you!
